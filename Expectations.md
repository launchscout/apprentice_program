# Expectations of Apprentices

This document outlines the overall growth and expectations that we will be using to measure apprentices as they progress through the program.

We teach apprentices in a variety of ways, some class work, some book club work, some live group coding, and various individual work outside of day to day pairing. Pair programming is a vital aspect of learning for apprentices because it gives them a chance to learn from someone whom both understands the system and knows how to write code to improve or create new systems.

## At the start

Apprentices will be coming in fresh and should have a basic understanding of programming in at least one language. This includes if/then statements, making variables or constants, writing elementry functions. They will be new to programming in a professional environment, so they will be learning to adjust to working on code bases as a team.

We expect the apprentices to:

* Particpate in planning, backlog grooming, sprint reviews, and retros. That includes pointing out stories and giving opinions where it makes sense.
* Start pair programming. Asking lots of questions, taking notes, and trying to learn as much as possible.
* Spend the time outside of pair programming (or at home) exploring topics they've taken notes on, learning when they can.
* Speak up and contribute by giving their understanding of the code they are looking at.

## End of month one

The apprentices should be progressing and should start to feel like part of the team. Many things will still be new or fresh, but they should be able to:

* Start driving more, at least 20% of the time. As a mid or senior dev, things will still feel slow while pairing, but should feel faster than Day 1.
* With support from the team, set up and run the application on their system
* Handle giving standup updates

## End of month two

The apprentices should be able to:

* Read/understand/pick the stories you are working on. They may still need help getting started on a story, but they should be able to reason out where and how to change code if you point them in the right direction
* They should at least be writing some tests, with help, to make sure the code is working as expected.
* Should feel more comfortable with how the front-end and back-end code talk to each other and interact.
* Should be able to explain a piece of code or ticket they worked on with a pair.
* Use a debugger effectively

## End of month three

They apprentices should be able to:

* Work on a development task that involves coding (story or subset of story) and do 100% of the typing of code.
* Start to understand what the team is/isn't responsible for.
* Contribute more heavily in the 30-50% driving range.
* Engaging as a navigator if they aren't driving (reading the code, making sure requirements are being met, etc)
* Start interacting with teams outside of the current team, as needed, for tickets
* Start learning a second programming language.
* Present their work to groups of developers/stakeholders

## End of month four

They apprentices should be able to:

* Should be voicing opinions on how to best approach code
* Should be able to figure out where code is and how to make the changes needed for tickets
* Have room to be wrong, but starting to get on the right track when understanding things.
* Start to feel comfortable in a second programming language.

## End of month five

They apprentices should be able to:

* Pick up tickets they aren't core day to day systems but need to be worked on (e.g. Echo at Kroger, or DevOps tickets)
* Feel 100% comfortable owning a ticket from start to finish
* Be comfortable picking up bug stories and working on them

## End of month six

They apprentices should be able to:

* Understand the difference between client validations and backend security.
* Work on emergency production issues.
* Articulate and express their ideas as part of a team setting, via code retros, normal retros, or in sprint planning.
* Feel comfortable guessing where an issue might be for bug fixing.
* Have the team's trust to handle and resolve almost any ticket.
